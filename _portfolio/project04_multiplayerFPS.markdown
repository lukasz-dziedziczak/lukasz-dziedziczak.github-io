This is an ongoing multiplayer game prototype that I'm currently working on. Despite being a work in progress, I'm excited to share the progress I've made in just one week of development. The focus of this project is to demonstrate smooth client-to-client connections, enabling both peer-to-peer and dedicated server options. Additionally, players can enjoy experimenting with the character creator to customize their avatars. As I continue to develop this project, I plan to introduce real-time gameplay, create immersive environments, and implement engaging mechanics. Keep an eye out for updates as I make further strides in this endeavor!
