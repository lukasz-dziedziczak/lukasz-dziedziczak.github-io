A compact yet impactful project realized in Unreal Engine 5. This creation, while modest in size, serves as a powerful testament to my proficiency within the engine. Within the immersive confines of a spaceship environment, I've meticulously orchestrated a player controller and enemy AI, resulting in an engaging gameplay experience of navigating and clearing the vessel from lurking adversaries. Complemented by thoughtfully chosen visual elements and atmospheric sounds, this project encapsulates Unreal Engine 5 competence, showcasing how even a smaller-scale endeavor can exude the essence of game development excellence.
