Just a quick game we threw together in three days.

Your goal is to collect all the bottles. You will need to solve platforming puzzles, pushing crates into place, to get to all the bottles. There are enemies patrolling, which will shoot you on sight. You may throw your collected bottles at them to knock them out.
