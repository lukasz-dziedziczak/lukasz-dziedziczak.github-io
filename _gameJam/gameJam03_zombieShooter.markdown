This is my solo dev submission to the 2024 GameDev.tv Game Jam.

A simple FPS where your goal is to survive the zombie horde coming at you.

You have two weapons, a rifle and a pistol, to defend yourself. You will find ammo as well as health packs through out the level.  You will need to avoid the water as it's radioactive.
